            Hi, welcome to Vivien Yang's page.
            </p>
            <p>
            So far, you will find a sparse personal website 
            that is still in progress. Before the year's end, there are plans to 
            put up some interesting projects relating to a gif search engine, a
            music inspiration tree, a fan casting interface, and possibly some 
            experimentation on resizing pictures on the web.
            </p>
            <p>
            I will also be putting up a gallery mostly consisting of figure drawing
            sketches. They are definitely not safe for work, but if you're an artist
            or if you're <em>mature</em> enough to not throw a fuss over nude art,
            feel free to peruse.
            </p>
